The easiest way to change the logo used by Odin is to replace the `logo.png` file in the `assets` folder with your logo. If you change the filename of your logo file, then make sure to update the `brand_logo` variable in `_config.yml`.

After editing your logo file, run `jekyll serve` to see the changes locally. If you're satisfied with your changes, run `jekyll build` and then push your changes to your repo.
